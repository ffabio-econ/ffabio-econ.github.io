I am fascinated by economic growth; the natural environment; and the act of lending. In my work I mainly employ statistical tools, such as cointegration models and dimension-reduction techniques, to study aggregate economic phenomena and mechanisms related to these themes, through the lenses of financial markets.

## Working papers

<div class="paper_entry"> <strong>(JMP) The long-run innovation risk component </strong> [<a href="#" class="toggleLink">Abstract</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/ffabio-econ/ffabio-econ.github.io/raw/main/assets/docs/franceschini-rdlrr.pdf">Paper</a>] 
<p class="abstracttxt" style="display: none;"> This paper provides evidence that aggregate Research and Development (R&D) investment drives a persistent component in productivity growth and that this embodies a risk priced in financial markets. In a semi-endogenous growth model, this component is identified by the R&D in excess of equilibrium levels and can be approximated by the Error Correction Term in the cointegration between R&D and Total Factor Productivity. Empirically, the component results being well defined and it satisfies all key theoretical predictions: it exhibits appropriate persistency, it forecasts productivity growth, and it is associated with a cross-sectional risk premium. </p>

<div class="paper_entry"><strong> Does CAPM overestimate more the risk or its price?</strong> [<a href="#" class="toggleLink">Abstract</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/ffabio-econ/ffabio-econ.github.io/raw/main/assets/docs/franceschini-lra.pdf">Paper</a>]
<p class="abstracttxt" style="display: none;"> CAPM is known to empirically underestimate expected returns of low-risk assets and overestimate those with high risk. This paper studies how risks omission and funding tightness jointly contribute to explaining this anomaly, with the former affecting the definition of assets’ riskiness and the latter affecting how risk is remunerated. Theoretically, the two effects are shown to counteract each other. Empirically, the spread related to binding leverage constraints is found to be significant at 2% yearly. Nonetheless, average returns of portfolios that exploit this anomaly are found to mostly reflect omitted risks, contrasting how they have been used in previous analysis. </p>

## Research in progress 

<div class="paper_entry"><strong>Are you betting on sustainability?</strong> [<a href="#" class="toggleLink">Abstract</a>]
<p class="abstracttxt" style="display: none;"> When sustainability of assets is appreciated, its effect on discount rates does not only depend on the sustainability of the asset priced, but it is intrinsically mediated by the risk profile of the asset. This has implications for the assessment of the sustainability-related spread and for hedging shocks to sustainability concern. Specifically, (1) long-short portfolios of assets sorted on sustainability can average returns with a sign unrelated to the actual sustainability spread and, consequently, (2) the effectiveness of more sustainable assets in hedging changes to sustainability concerns depends on their ‘sustainability intensity’ and their risk <i>jointly</i>. Estimations employing the Refinitiv ESG scores for US stocks shows a weak sustainability premium, whose significance, importantly, diverges from that of average return of a plain long-short portfolio. </p>
