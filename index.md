<p style="margin-block: 10px;"> <strong> The long-run innovation risk component </strong> <i> (Job Market Paper)</i></p>

<p style="padding-left:25px"> I estimate a measure of aggregate R&D expenditure intensity yielded by a cointegration relationship implied by an approximation of most standard semi-endogenous growth models. I provide evidence that this measure identifies a component of long-run productivity risk by showing its forecasting power with respect to other macroeconomic quantities and the strength of the cross-sectional risk premium related to portfolios’ cash flows sensitivities to this measure. </p>


<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-block: 10px;">Does CAPM overestimate more the risk or its price?</p>

<p style="padding-left:25px"> I show that two explanations of the CAPM low-risk anomaly, one related to funding frictions and the other to coskewness risk, interact in an ambiguous way, being partly complements and part substitutes. I establish the mutually excluding effects to be dominating and then, with the potential of one to completely undermine the other, I proceed showing to which extent both contribute in explaining such anomaly. </p>
