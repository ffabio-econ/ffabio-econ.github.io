<p style="margin-block: 10px;"> <strong> The long-run innovation risk component </strong> <i>  </i></p>

<p style="padding-left:25px"> I provide empirical support to the long-run productivity risk framework of asset pricing. I do so by studying a measure of aggregate R&D expenditure intensity implied by a cointegration relationship approximately holding in most standard semi-endogenous growth models. As predicted by theory, this measure shows great forecasting power with respect to relevant macroeconomic quantities such as the TFP and consumption growth rates. This measure also proves being highly persistent and being related to a significant cross-sectional risk premium, where risk is limited to stocks’ cash flows sensitivities, which are the key features to identify a long-run productivity risk component. </p>


<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-block: 10px;">Does CAPM overestimate more the risk or its price?</p>

<p style="padding-left:25px"> I reframe the CAPM deviations in a flexible and concise representation that allows for both financial frictions and systematic risks beyond the market returns. This enable an empirical investigation to assess the extent to which the CAPM low-risk anomaly is due to funding frictions, which survive any risk factor, or omitted risk factors, even ones not yet explored. </p>
