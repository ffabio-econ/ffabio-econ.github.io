<p style="margin-block: 10px;"> <strong> The long-run innovation risk component </strong> <i>  </i></p>

<p class="abstracttxt"> A persistent component in productivity growth has been shown to be related to a persistent component in consumption, which has significant implications for asset prices. As one of the main drivers of productivity growth is known to be innovation yielded from Research and Development (R&D) expenses, this paper studies a measure of R&D intensity defined by the stationary deviations in R&D investment from the equilibrium level in a semi-endogenous growth model. This results being the error correction term of the cointegration between R&D expenditures and the productivity level. This R&D intensity measure strongly forecasts productivity growth and proves having a persistence that matches well previous evidence on the productivity growth <i>long-run risk component</i>, thus supporting its identification of a long-run <i>innovation</i> risk component and all of the long-run risk framework. This is then verified testing the financial implications: stocks' cash flows sensitivities to this measure are proven being associated with a significant cross-sectional risk premium.

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-block: 10px;">Does CAPM overestimate more the risk or its price?</p>

<p class="abstracttxt"> This paper studies the contributions of tight financial constraints and risk factors other than the market in explaining the CAPM low risk anomaly. It theoretically shows the counteracting effect they have on each other and empirically measures the share of CAPM mispricing that each of them accounts for. While the spread on zero-beta assets originated in leverage constraints proves being extremely significant, it does not appear to play the biggest role in explaining the anomaly. Risk factors agnostically extracted from test assets end up explaining all of the predicted return of the BAB portfolio as formed by Frazzini and Pedersen (2014, JFE) and two thirds of the BAB portfolio formed as in Novy-Marx and Velikov (2022, JFE), although the latter is not significantly different from an equal contribution of 50%.

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-block: 10px;">Sustainability premium and risk: Betting Against Sustainability?</p>

<p class="abstracttxt"> When sustainability of assets is appreciated, its effect on discount rates does not only depend on the sustainability of the asset priced, but it is intrinsically mediated by the risk profile of the asset. This has implications for the assessment of the sustainability-related spread and for hedging shocks to sustainability concern. Specifically, (1) long-short portfolios of assets sorted on sustainability can average returns with a sign unrelated to the actual sustainability spread and, consequently, (2) the effectiveness of more sustainable assets in hedging changes to the sustainability spead depends on their ‘sustainability intensity’ and their risk <i>jointly</i>. Currently, this is tested on the Refinitiv ESG scores for US data, with inconclusive evidence regarding the existence of a ESG-related premium in the first place.
